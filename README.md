This repository contains elements for a hotel management system that I designed for my final 
project in SWDV 630: Object-Oriented Software Architecture at Maryville University.

app.py contains code demonstrating the main functionality of the objects in my system.

The documentation folder contains diagrams, a ui sketch, and use case elaborations.
